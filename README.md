# VSD_Physical_Design_workshop_1
It was a 5 day workshop, which was based on VLSI backend flow, where we worked on RTL to GDS flow with open source EDA tools.
The tools included:
1. Yosys: for Sythesis (.v) generation.
2. Graywolf: for Floorplaning, Placement and CTS (clock tree synthesis).
3. Qrouter: for complete routing of design.
4. Opentimer: for STA (Static Time Analysis).
5. Magic: for Layout view, extraction, DRC.
6. Ngspice: for spice simulation.
7. Qflow: all the above tools are appended in this GUI.

The main idea of the workshop was that each day everyone who had signed up got indiviual assingments which included a MCQ test, videos on the concepts of the MCQ and lab instruction and the MQC test also included questions based on lab.
